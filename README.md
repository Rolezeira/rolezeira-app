# rolezeira-app

This is a app inspired in a whatsapp group named Rolezeira. The members are university classmates that became best friends even since the classes has fineshed.

This app is building only to learn Ionicframework stuffs, so I'll put some features from a basic social network, chat and some features that whatsapp don't do, like Instagram polls.

The Firebase will be used like the backend layer because it's easy to use, and common to a mpv or hello-world app.

## Features:

Feed:
-  post some stuff with images, text and links.
-  the post can be voted and maybe removed by more dislike.
-  the post can be commented, maybe the comment would be commented too.

Poll:
-  the poll will be used to decide something like go to Madero Restaurant or Outback on friday.

Chat:
-  the last one builded and maybe never used, I'll test it, but the chat is like a web group chat not private chat.
